    "Let's look at the distribution of inspection scores. As we saw before when we called head on this data frame, inspection scores appear to be integer values. The discreteness of this variable means that we can use a bar plot to visualize the distribution of the inspection score. Make a bar plot of the counts of the number of inspections receiving each score.\n",
